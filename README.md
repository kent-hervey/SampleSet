Created this small, simple project as contribution to team assignment.

Entry point/main method in Application.java

SampleSet creates and returns as set based on arguments passed in:
   * Quantity = number of elements in produced set
   * max = maximum value of any element in the produced set
   * min = minimum value of any element in the produced set
   * max -min range must be large enough to accommodate quantity

Elements are selected randomly to fill the set.

Uses TreeSet to produce sorted result.
